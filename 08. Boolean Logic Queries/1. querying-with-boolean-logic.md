### Querying with boolean logic


**must**

The clause (query) must appear in matching documents and will contribute to the score.

**filter**

The clause (query) must appear in matching documents. However unlike must the score of the query will be ignored. Filter clauses are executed in filter context, meaning that scoring is ignored and clauses are considered for caching.

**should**

The clause (query) should appear in the matching document.

**must_not**

The clause (query) must not appear in the matching documents. Clauses are executed in filter context meaning that scoring is ignored and clauses are considered for caching. Because scoring is ignored, a score of 0 for all documents is returned.


##### Adding query clauses to the `must` key

```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "parmesan"
          }
        },
        {
          "range": {
            "preparation_time_minutes": {
              "lte": 15
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

##### Moving the `range` query to the `filter` key

```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "parmesan"
          }
        }
      ],
      "filter": [
        {
          "range": {
            "preparation_time_minutes": {
              "lte": 15
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

##### Adding a query clause to the `must_not` key

```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "parmesan"
          }
        }
      ],
      "must_not": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "tuna"
          }
        }
      ],
      "filter": [
        {
          "range": {
            "preparation_time_minutes": {
              "lte": 15
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

##### Adding a query clause to the `should` key

Note : 

**must** means: The clause (query) must appear in matching documents. These clauses must match, like logical AND.

**should** means: At least one of these clauses must match, like logical OR.

Basically they are used like logical operators AND and OR. See this.

_Now in a bool query:

**must** means: Clauses that must match for the document to be included.

**should means**: If these clauses match, they increase the _score; otherwise, they have no effect. They are simply used to refine the relevance score for each document.

```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "parmesan"
          }
        }
      ],
      "must_not": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "tuna"
          }
        }
      ],
      "should": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "parsley"
          }
        }
      ],
      "filter": [
        {
          "range": {
            "preparation_time_minutes": {
              "lte": 15
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

##### The behavior of `should` query clauses depends

```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "pasta"
          }
        }
      ],
      "should": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "parmesan"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

```
GET /recipe/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        {
          "match": {
            "ingredients.name": "parmesan"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
